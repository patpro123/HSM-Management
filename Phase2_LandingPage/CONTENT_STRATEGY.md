### FAQ Section

```
"Questions? We've Got Answers"
"Everything You Need to Know"
"Common Questions Answered"

Recommended: "Questions? We've Got Answers"
```

#### FAQ Content

**Q1: What age groups do you accept?**
```
We welcome students from 5 years old to adults of any age. 
Music has no age limit! Our teachers adapt their teaching 
style to suit each age group—from playful learning for kids 
to structured lessons for adults.
```

**Q2: Do I need my own instrument to start?**
```
Not immediately. We have instruments available at the school 
for practice during class time. However, we recommend getting 
your own instrument within the first month for home practice, 
which is essential for progress. We can guide you on affordable 
options and where to purchase.
```

**Q3: Can I switch instruments mid-course?**
```
Yes, though we recommend completing at least 3 months with 
your chosen instrument first. This allows you to develop 
foundational skills before exploring others. Many students 
eventually learn multiple instruments!
```

**Q4: What if I miss a class?**
```
We understand life happens! If you inform us at least 24 hours 
in advance, we'll arrange a makeup class in another batch or 
schedule. Our portal makes it easy to track your attendance 
and request makeups.
```

**Q5: Are classes available online?**
```
Yes, we offer online classes for Keyboard and Guitar. While 
we believe in-person learning is ideal for most instruments, 
our online option provides flexibility for students who can't 
attend physically.
```

**Q6: How long until I can play a song?**
```
Most beginners can play simple songs within 2-3 months with 
regular practice. Complex pieces take longer, but you'll see 
steady progress from your very first lesson. We celebrate 
every milestone with you!
```

**Q7: What's your refund policy?**
```
We offer a 100% refund if you're not satisfied after your 
first 2 classes. After that, refunds are prorated based on 
classes attended. See our full policy for details.
```

**Q8: Can I choose my teacher?**
```
While we assign teachers based on batch schedules and expertise, 
we're happy to discuss preferences. All our teachers are highly 
qualified, and most students develop great rapport with whoever 
they're paired with.
```

**Q9: Do you provide certificates?**
```
Yes! Students receive certificates upon completing milestone 
levels. We also help prepare students for external examination 
boards (Trinity, ABRSM) if desired.
```

**Q10: What's the class size?**
```
We keep batches small (maximum 8 students) to ensure personalized 
attention. For advanced students, we also offer one-on-one lessons 
at a premium.

## 4. Writing Best Practices ✅

### Do's
- **Use Active Voice:** "We teach" not "Teaching is provided"
- **Be Specific:** "15+ expert teachers" not "many teachers"
- **Show, Don't Tell:** "500+ students" not "very popular"
- **Address Reader Directly:** "Your journey" not "A journey"
- **Use Power Words:** Discover, master, transform, unlock, achieve
- **Keep it Scannable:** Short paragraphs, bullet points, bold key phrases

### Don'ts
- **Avoid Jargon:** Say "beginner-friendly" not "pedagogically accessible"
- **Don't Be Vague:** Avoid "quality education" without specifics
- **Skip Clichés:** Avoid "state-of-the-art" or "world-class" without proof
- **Don't Oversell:** Be honest about timelines and difficulty
- **Avoid Negative Framing:** "Never too late" not "Don't think you're too old"

## 5. SEO Keyword Integration 🔍

### Secondary Keywords (Use in Body Copy)
- "[Instrument] lessons for beginners"
- "Online music classes"
- "Professional music teachers"
- "Music education [location]"
- "Learn [instrument] online"

### Keyword Density Guidelines
- **Primary Keywords:** 2-3 times per page
- **Secondary Keywords:** 5-7 times total
- **Natural Integration:** Always prioritize readability over SEO

### Example Natural Integration
```

    in Hyderabad for students in Hyderabad."

    the city learn keyboard, guitar, drums, and more from expert
